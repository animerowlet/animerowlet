Facebook users are reporting a new **glitch** that is sending **automatic** **friend** **requests** to anyone they **view** on the social media platform. The glitch appears to be affecting both the mobile and desktop versions of Facebook.

When a user **clicks** on a profile, they are **immediately** sent a friend request. This can be embarrassing for users who are simply trying to view someone's profile for information or to see if they know them. ( I cant even think about the level of embarrassment that they are facing. ;-; )

I believe Facebook will try to fix it as soon as possible. Till then why don't you just scroll through the feeds.

Some people are looking this glitch from a more unique way. It could be seen as a **privacy** **nightmare**.

Facebook is a social media platform that is designed to connect people with friends and family. However, the friend request glitch could be seen as a way for Facebook to collect data on users.

When a user clicks on a profile, they are providing Facebook with information about that person. This information could be used to target users with ads or to track their online activity.

But this is just a **small** **glitch** which happens time to time on **every** **platform**. So dont need to worry about it. Some people just love thrashing Facebook on these **silly** **glitches** which i want you to pay no mind.
